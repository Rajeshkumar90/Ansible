module: win_addpath
version_added: "2.3"
short_description: Append Path environment variables on windows hosts.
description:
    - Uses .net Environment to set path environment variables and can set at User, Machine and Process level.  
    - User level path environment variables will be set, but available until the particular session is closed.
options:

 pathvalue:
    description: 
      - The value to store in the path environment variable.
    required: true
    default: no default
 level:
    description: 
      - The level at which to set the environment variable.
      - Use 'machine' to set for all users.
      - Use 'user' to set for the current user that ansible is connected as.
      - Use 'process' to set for the current process.  Probably not that useful.
    required: true
    default: no default
    choices:
      - machine
      - process
      - user
author: "Syed, RajeshKumar"
notes: 
   - This module does not broadcast change events.  
     This means that the minority of windows applications which can have 
     their environment changed without restarting will not be notified and 
     therefore will need restarting to pick up new environment settings.  
     User level environment variables will not require the user to log out 
     and in again before they become available.
